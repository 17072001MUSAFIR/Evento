Project is submitted

About the project: This is an event portal for a collage. In this portal a user can register. Each user have seperate interface. At the first time of login they want complete the profile. Then they can see their profile ad update it if needed in the profile link in the side nav.They can able to create events, register events, cancel registered events.

About live link project : we attach the link in this readme and also as a file named 'live link' later. Because we do not think that it is required, we do it locally.
                          We are using a mysql database and it is not working in replit, So we want more time to study and create a replit database.
                          NB:- Also we are creating a file called 'dbdetails' in the Project Code folder it contains all the details of Database.
